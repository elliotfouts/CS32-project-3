# CS 32 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Taught using C++, CS 32 is UCLA's introduction to common data structures in computer science. With the exception of [project 3](https://github.com/elliotfouts/UCLA-Work/tree/master/CS%2032%20-%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms), the homework assignments and projects we were assigned would not be very impressive to look at but provided valuable practice for the subjets we learned.
#### Topics covered 
* Memory management (destructors, copy constructors, assignment operators)
* OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, ...)
* Recursion
* Algorithm time analysis (Big O)
* Common data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs)
* Common Algorithms (sorting, searching)
