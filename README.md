# CS 32 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Taught using C++, CS 32 is UCLA's introduction to common data structures in computer science. With the exception of [project 3](), the homework assignments and projects we were assigned would not be very impressive to look at but provided valuable practice for the subjets we learned.
##### topics covered 
* Memory management (destructors, copy constructors, assignment operators)
* OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, ...)
* Recursion
* Algorithm analysis (Big O)
* Common data structures 
  * linked lists 
  * stacks
  * queues 
  * trees 
  * hash tables 
* Common Algorithms 
  * sorting algorithms (mergesort, quicksort, heapsort, introsort)
  * search algorithms (binary search, BFS, DFS)
